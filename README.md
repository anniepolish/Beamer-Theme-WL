# Beamer-mhthm
A customizable and modern Beamer theme for LaTeX presentations, with a default color scheme that makes it ready for presentations @uniPG.
Take a look at it and learn how to use it in [this](https://gitlab.com/harisont/Beamer-mhthm/blob/master/how-to.pdf) presentation.

You're encouraged to fork this repository and improve the theme, but please don't ask me too many questions about it, I had no idea what I was doing!
