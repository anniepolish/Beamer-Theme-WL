# Beamer-mhthm
A customizable and modern Beamer theme for LaTeX presentations, with a default color scheme that makes it ready for presentations at Yale Wright Lab.

Forked from harisont's recoloring of [Beamer-Themes-Execushares](https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/better-beamer-themes/)

You're encouraged to fork this repository and improve the theme, but please don't ask me too many questions about it, I had no idea what I was doing!
